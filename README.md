# oscal-pki-policy-converter
A tool to convert an RFC 3647 PKI Policy to an OSCAL Catalog 

# Requirements
This version has been tested on linux, and requires python 3.12 as well as [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

Future versions will be installable without these requirements.

# ROADMAP
The following items are on our short term roadmap:

- ~~Abstract and parameterize the configuration of the parser, so that it is easier to adapt to different policies.~~ DONE!
- Expand the output from a basic OSCAL catalog to a richer version that better supports the audit processes.
- Update the tool to simplify deployment and installation.
